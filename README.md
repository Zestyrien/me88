# ME88

I developed an interest for compilers and processors. I wanted to know what was happening from the moment the code was written to the moment it was executed. However modern compilers and processors are big and complicated and not for a single man effort. 
This is why I toke the Verilog implementation of a didactic processor that we studied at university, the ME88, and turned it into a simulation. 
I also coded a basic compiler. 
The final goal is to code run an operative system.
